Hi, I'm Mark.

I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at the University of Oxford in 2010, before pursuing my PhD at the University of Reading under the supervision of [Professor Kenneth Shankland](https://www.reading.ac.uk/pharmacy/staff/professor-kenneth-shankland).

I now do scientific research in my spare time. I'm principally interested in solving the crystal structures of small molecules using powder diffraction data - a continuation of the topic of my PhD. I also like learning about and applying machine learning to interesting problems.

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy BJJ, playing the drums and cooking.
