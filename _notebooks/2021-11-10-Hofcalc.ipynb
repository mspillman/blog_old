    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An [article](http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0108768101021814) published in 2001 by D. W. M. Hofmann describes how crystallographic databases can be used to derive the average volume occupied by atoms of each element in crystal structures. Using his tabulated values, it's possible to rapidly estimate the volume occupied by a given molecule, and use this to aid indexing of powder diffraction data. This is particularly useful for labotartory diffraction data, which is generally associated with lower figures of merit such as de Wolff's $M_{20}$ and Smith and Snyder's $F_N$, which can make discriminating between alternative options more challenging. Other volume estimation methods, notably the 18 Ã… rule are also commonly used, though Hofmann's volumes give generally more accurate results.\n",

    "\n",
    "After applying various filters to crystal structures deposited in the CSD, Hofmann ended up with a dataset comprised of 182239 structures. Hofmann only considers the elements up to atomic number 100 (fermium) in his work, and assumes that the volume of the unit cell is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{est} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{100} n_i\\bar{v_i}(1+\\bar{\\alpha}T) = \\bold{n\\bar{v}}(1+\\bar{\\alpha}T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n_i$ is the number of atoms of element $i$ in the unit cell, and $\\bar{v_i}$ is the average volume occupied by an atom of element $i$. This equation also assumes that the atomic volume varies linearly with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "He split the dataset into 20 subsets, then applied linear regression to solve the above equation for each of the subsets. This allowed him to find the average volumes occupied by atoms of each element, and due to the splitting of the data into subsets, he also obtains their standard deviations. His use of a temperature parameter allowed him to provide volumes for all of the elements represented in the CSD at 298 K.\n",
