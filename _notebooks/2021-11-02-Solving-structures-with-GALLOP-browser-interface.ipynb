    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [previous post](https://mspillman.github.io/blog/gallop/pxrd/python/2021/10/30/Introduction-to-GALLOP.html), I went over the rationale behind *GALLOP* and some details about the algorithm. These details will be relevant later on in this post when we go over some of the settings used to control *GALLOP*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll go over how to use *GALLOP* to solve the crystal structure of verapamil hydrochloride, a calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of arryhythmias. If you want to have a go yourself, you can download the diffraction data in xye format [here](https://github.com/mspillman/blog/_notebooks/files/Verap.xye) or my complete set of fit files in a zip archive [here](https://github.com/mspillman/blog/_notebooks/files/verapamil_hydrochloride.zip). If you don't have access to *DASH*, I recommend downloading the full set of fit files so you have access to the Z-matrices which may otherwise be tedious to generate by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst not relevant for verapamil hydrochloride which crystallises in $P\\bar{1}$, note that currently *GALLOP* requires the space group to be in the standard setting so if you have a known unit cell in a particular non-standard space group, you should transform it to the standard setting before fitting your diffraction data for *GALLOP*."

    "# Fitting PXRD data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitting data with *DASH*\n",
    "Follow the procedure laid out in the [*DASH* user guide tutorial section [pdf warning]](https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/support-and-resources/ccdcresources/dash.pdf) to fit the diffraction data. You should also use DASH to generate your Z-matrices if you do not have them already. To do this, you will need a 3D molecular representation of verapamil hydrochloride which can be read in by *DASH* and converted to a Z-matrix (ZM). If you don't want to generate one yourself, I recommend using the CSD reference code CURHOM as the basis for your ZMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Pawley refinement has finished, save the files as normal, and ensure you have access to the resultant ```.sdi, .dsl, .hcv, .pik``` and ```.tic``` files. If you do not want to include [Mogul Distribution Bias]() to bias the starting points for the torsion angles, and you already have ZMs available, you can close *DASH* at this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to make use of MDB information and/or need to generate ZMs, continue on through the wizard to the settings for solving the structure with simulated annealing. Read in your molecule file to generate ZMs if required. If you wish to use MDB in your SDPD attempt, follow the instructions in section 10.3.4 in the *DASH* user guide (linked above). You will then need to generate a single *DASH* batch file using the Create batch file option highlighted in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/dbf_write.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resultant ```.dbf``` file should be made available along with the Pawley fit files produced earlier and ZMs ready for use in *GALLOP*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitting data with *GSAS-II*\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, I recommend having the *DASH* produced Z-matrices (ZMs) available to save time generating one in the correct format from scratch. Eventually, I'd like to include the ability to generate ZMs natively in *GALLOP*, but that's a few updates down the line at the moment!\n",
    "\n",
    "For a reference of the format expected if you do want to have a go at making your own, please see [here](https://github.com/mspillman/gallop#z-matrices) for an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The *GSAS-II* tutorials](https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS/trunk/help/Tutorials.html) should be used as a guide for how to proceed with [indexing data](https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS/Tutorials/FitPeaks/Fit%20Peaks.htm) and subsequent [Pawley refinement - follow to end of Step 2](https://subversion.xray.aps.anl.gov/pyGSAS/Tutorials/FitPeaks/Fit%20Peaks.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "GSAS-II by default uses the *Analytic Hessian* optimisation method. According to the documentation:\n",
    "*\"It uses a custom-developed least-squares minimizer that uses singular-value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the errors caused by correlated variables and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to up-weight diagonal Hessian terms when refinements fail to lower $\\chi^{2}$\"*. The alterations to the Pawley covariance matrix this introduces causes errors when used in *GALLOP* (for example, the covariance matrix cannot be inverted or the inverse covariance matrix is not positive-definite, resulting in the potential for negative values of $\\chi^2$). To fix this issue, I suggest the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pawley fit the data as directed in the GSAS-II Tutorials - the analytic Hessian method can be used for this.\n",
    "2. One happy with the fit, set **all** refined parameters apart from peak intensities (e.g. peak shape, background etc) as unrefineable.\n",
    "3. See figure below: i. Reset all intensities using Pawley create, ii. The intensities will be set back to 100, but not flagged for refinement. iii. Set all intensities to refine (highlight column by clicking the refine column heading, then press Y on your keyboard), iii. Go to Controls and select *Analytic Jacobian* from the drop-down menu.\n",
    "4. Refine\n",
    "5. Once refinement is complete, save the project file, and ensure that the .gpx GSAS-II project file and the ZMs are available for use in *GALLOP*.\n",

    "```\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Username> conda activate gallop\n",

    "\n",
    "I will write another blog post in the future showing how to deploy GALLOP on the Google Compute Engine cloud environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once GALLOP is running, we will be using the following steps to solve the crystal structure of verapamil hydrochloride:\n",

If you wish to use MDB to bias the initial torsion angles used in *GALLOP*, you should also upload the ```.dbf``` file produce earlier. Note that this will only be used to set the MDB torsion angle biasing, and none of the other settings included in the MDB will be used by *GALLOP*.\n",

    "\n",
    "With only 23 degrees of freedom, verapamil hydrochloride is a relatively simple crystal structure for *GALLOP* and the default settings should be sufficient to solve it. However, we will make a small change to increase our chance of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the Particle Swarm menu in the side bar to expand it. We will then increase the number of swarms from 10 to 20 either by using the + symbol to increment the number, or by deleting the 10 and typing in 20:\n",

Once this has finished, the main *GALLOP* iterations will begin, with their own progress bar to track their progress. Once the first iteration has finished, some additional items will appear on screen. Two expandable boxes (discussed below) will appear, followed by a download link with the text \"CIFs for run 1\". Lastly, a table of results for each iteration is displayed, as is an interactive figure showing the $\\chi^2$ value found by each of the particles in each of the swarms. You can use your scroll wheel to zoom in, and click to drag to explore this plot without interrupting *GALLOP*.\n",

    "Once you are finished, you can safely close the browser window. If running on your local machine, you can then close down the command line window you opened earlier. If running on a cloud notebook, you may wish to shut down the notebook (if using Colab or Kaggle) to conserve your useage quota, or if using a paid service, you may wish to shut down your VM in order to reduce costs."
