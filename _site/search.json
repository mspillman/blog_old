    "text": "This post is intended to give an overview of GALLOP, an algorithm I recently published alongside my friend, PhD supervisor and colleague, Prof. Kenneth Shankland. If you aren’t familiar with global optimisation (GO) methods for crystal structure determination from powder diffraction data (SDPD), I recommend the following resources: - Experimental Analysis of Powder Diﬀraction Data - An overview of currently used structure determination methods for powder diffraction data - The principles underlying the use of powder diffraction data in solving pharmaceutical crystal structures\nAbbreviations I’ll be using: - SDPD = Crystal structure determination from powder diffraction data - PXRD = Powder X-ray diffraction data - GO = Global optimisation - LO = Local optimisation - GPU = Graphics processing unit - CPU = Central processing unit - SA = Simulated annealing - PSO = Particle swarm optimisation - ML = Machine learning\n\n\nGALLOP is the culmination of several years of work, which kicked off back in 2010 with an article published by Kenneth Shankland and co-workers, who showed that contrary to the wisdom at the time, local optimisation (LO) algorithms were capable of solving the crystal structures of small molecules, provided that several tens of thousands of attempts from random starting positions on the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) hypersurface were performed. In addition to solving the crystal structure, this also gives the locations of the stationary points on the hypersurface.\nInterestingly, they showed that using this method, the global minimum on the hypersurface was located more frequently than any other minimum. This indicates that “the topology of the surface is such that the net ‘catchment’ area of stationary points with very low values of \\(\\chi^{2}\\) is significantly larger than that of the vast majority of stationary points.” The figure below, taken from the article, shows the distribution of \\(\\chi^{2}\\) values for stationary points on the 15-dimensional hypersurface for capsaicin.\n\n\n\nShankland et al, 2010\n\n\nI carried on investigating this method as part of my PhD, and my results confirmed that this approach is effective at solving crystal structures, even of high-complexity (up to 42 degrees of freedom!). However, despite the intriguing results, the approach was not adopted on a wide scale by the SDPD community, perhaps because the performance it offers is approximately the same existing GO-based programs. The code I was using was written in C++, a language I do not know at all well, so I was unable to contribute much to its further development.\nA few years after finishing my PhD, I decided I wanted to try writing my own SDPD code in Python. Whilst Python is notoriously slow, my rationale was that Python is much easier to learn than C++, so should provide a lower barrier to entry for people seeking to try out new ideas for SDPD. My first prototype used numpy to try to speed up the code, and borrowed heavily from pymatgen, a fantastic open-source library with lots of crystallographic functionality. Eventually with some help from Kenneth, I had a system which allowed me to easily try out lots of different algorithms, such as those included in scipy.optimize, which features a variety of local and global optimisation algorithms.\nIn parallel to this, it seemed like every day incredible new results from the field of deep learning were coming out, showing state-of-the-art performance in wide variety of domains. Most neural networks are trained using backpropagation, an algorithm which makes use of automatic differentiation to calculate the gradient of the cost function (which provides a measure of how well the neural network is performing its task) with respect to the parameters of the neural network. Variants of stochastic gradient descent are then used to modify the parameters of the neural network in order to improve the performance of the neural network as measured by the cost function. Whilst neural networks have been in use for over half a century, part of the reason for the explosion in activity was the availability of GPUs and tools to leverage their parallel processing capabilities.\nI took an interest in this, and quickly realised that most of the libraries used for this work had well supported python APIs. Some of them, such as PyTorch, are so similar to numpy that it seemed logical to try to port my code to make use of these libraries. This would give both GPU-acceleration and automatic differentiation capabilities for relatively little effort!\n\n\n\nWith my code now capable of running on GPUs, it might seem obvious to implement GPU-versions of commonly used existing algorithms for SDPD such as simulated annealing (SA), parallel tempering and others. However, despite the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs, I found that the performance with GO methods is not particularly good (at least with my code!). Using SA as an example, then yes, it’s possible to run thousands of simultaneous runs on a single GPU, but the number of iterations that can be performed per second is laughably slow in comparison to performance on a CPU. Therefore, because algorithms like SA take a large number of iterations converge, the performance benefits of parallel processing are offset by the amount of time needed to process the large number of iterations required to reach the global minimum.\nIn contrast to GO algorithms, LO algorithms with access to gradients converge much more rapidly. The automatic differentiation capabilities provided by PyTorch allow gradients to be calculated rapidly, without any additional code to be written. The gradients so obtained are exactly equivalent to the analytical gradient, and are obtained much more rapidly than the approximate gradient that would be obtained via the method of finite differences. Therefore, when processing large numbers of LO runs on a GPU, because they converge much more rapidly than GO methods, you don’t need to wait for a long time to know if any of the runs have been successful!\nThe next piece of the puzzle is the idea that even if the global minimum is not located (i.e. the structure hasn’t yet been solved), the previously optimised positions may contain some useful information about the crystal structure. This might not be obvious at first, but let’s try to convince ourselves by taking a look at the hypersurface of verapamil hydrochloride, a structure with 23 degrees of freedom. This interactive figure shows a 2D slice through the hypersurface with all degrees of freedom set to their correct crystallographic values, apart from the fractional coordinates of the verapamil molecule along a and b, which form the axes plotted here.\n\n\nCode\n# This cell generates the Plotly html figure\nimport numpy as np\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport torch\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\ndisplay(HTML('''&lt;script src=\"/static/components/requirejs/require.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;'''))\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=False)\n\nnum = 151 # dimensionality of grid for the plot\nx = np.linspace(0,1,num)\ny = np.linspace(0,1,num)\n\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n\nif not os.path.exists(\"chisquared.csv\"):\n\n    from gallop.structure import Structure\n    from gallop import tensor_prep\n    from gallop import zm_to_cart\n    from gallop import intensities\n    from gallop import chi2\n    from gallop import files\n\n\n\n    struct = Structure(name=\"Verap\", ignore_H_atoms=True)\n    struct.add_data(\"./files/Verap.sdi\", source=\"DASH\")\n    struct.add_zmatrix(\"./files/CURHOM_1.zmatrix\", verbose=False)\n    struct.add_zmatrix(\"./files/CURHOM_2.zmatrix\", verbose=False)\n    struct.get_total_degrees_of_freedom(verbose=False)\n\n    # Coordinates of global minimum\n    g_external = np.array([0.68394345,0.45950916,-0.114383094,0.2456631,-0.29722878,\n                            -0.10422839,0.3358067,0.7402369,0.7596887,-0.16798618])\n\n    g_internal = np.array([-1.2276717,2.9165819,-0.96692395,-1.2034712,3.2261908,\n                            2.1036072,-3.2097023,-3.0328763,1.5661795,-0.0071008434,\n                            -0.1824131,-0.05715108,0.27950087])\n\n    global_min = np.hstack([g_external,g_internal])\n\n    vectors = np.zeros((2, struct.total_degrees_of_freedom)).astype(np.float32)\n    dims = (3,4) # This corresponds to verap along a, b\n    vectors[0][dims[0]] = 1\n    vectors[1][dims[1]] = 1\n\n    points = []\n    for x_point in x:\n        for y_point in y:\n            temp = np.copy(global_min)\n            temp[dims[0]] = 0\n            temp[dims[1]] = 0\n            points.append(temp + (vectors[0]*x_point) + (vectors[1]*y_point))\n\n    points = np.array(points)\n    external = points[:,:struct.total_external_degrees_of_freedom]\n    internal = points[:,struct.total_external_degrees_of_freedom:]\n\n    tensors = tensor_prep.get_all_required_tensors(struct, external=external,\n                                            internal=internal, requires_grad=False)\n\n    asymmetric_frac_coords = zm_to_cart.get_asymmetric_coords(**tensors[\"zm\"])\n\n    calculated_intensities = intensities.calculate_intensities(asymmetric_frac_coords,\n                                                         **tensors[\"int_tensors\"])\n\n    chisquared = chi2.calc_int_chisqd(calculated_intensities, **tensors[\"chisqd_tensors\"])\n\n    chisquared = chisquared.cpu().numpy()\n\n    np.savetxt(\"chisquared.csv\", chisquared, delimiter=\",\")\n\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(\"chisquared.csv\", header=None)\n    chisquared = df.values\n\n# create figure\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add surface trace\nfig.add_trace(go.Surface(z=chisquared.reshape(xx.shape).T, x=x, y=y, colorscale=\"Inferno\"))\n\n# Update plot sizing\nfig.update_layout(\n    width=700,\n    height=600,\n    autosize=False,\n    margin=dict(t=0, b=0, l=0, r=0),\n    template=\"plotly_white\",\n)\n\n# Update 3D scene options\nfig.update_scenes(\n    aspectratio=dict(x=1, y=1, z=0.8),\n    aspectmode=\"manual\"\n)\n\n# Add dropdown\nfig.update_layout(\n    updatemenus=[\n        dict(\n            buttons=list([\n                dict(\n                    args=[\"type\", \"surface\"],\n                    label=\"3D Surface\",\n                    method=\"restyle\"\n                ),\n                dict(\n                    args=[\"type\", \"contour\"],\n                    label=\"Contour\",\n                    method=\"restyle\"\n                )\n            ]),\n            direction=\"down\",\n            pad={\"r\": 10, \"t\": 10},\n            showactive=True,\n            x=0.1,\n            xanchor=\"left\",\n            y=1.1,\n            yanchor=\"top\"\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n# Add annotation\nfig.update_layout(\n    annotations=[\n        dict(text=\"Plot type:\", showarrow=False,\n        x=0, y=1.085, yref=\"paper\", align=\"left\")\n    ],\n    xaxis=dict(\n        title='a',\n    ),\n    yaxis=dict(\n        title='b',\n    ),\n    scene_camera_eye=dict(x=-1, y=-3, z=0.9),\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nI’ll write another blog post in the future showing how to use the GALLOP code to generate plots like this.\nThere are several local minima present, each of which represents an incorrect structure that has either 21 or 22 of its 23 degrees of freedom correctly determined. Despite this, the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) at each local minimum gives no indication that the result is so close to correct. This means that even failed runs with high values of \\(\\chi^{2}\\) may be close to the global minimum. If we could accumulate and exploit this information to influence where the next set of local optimisations start, then it might be possible to save time in searching for the global minimum.\nWith this idea in mind, I tried a few things to attempt to recycle information from “failed” local optimisation attempts, including using kernel density estimation to try to resample various degrees of freedom depending based on the density of solutions that ended up with particular coordinates. This definitely showed an improvement relative to random sampling, but proved inconsistent in terms of the level of improvement obtained. Perhaps I’ll revisit this in a future blog post as I still think there’s something there that may be of use.\nEventually, I ended up trying particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to attempt to recycle the optimised positions. A few things attracted me to PSO: 1. It’s a simple algorithm to implement - just a few lines of code got it working as a proof of concept 2. The algorithm maintains a memory of “good” solutions so there’s less risk of the algorithm moving in a bad direction and getting stuck there 3. It’s shown great performance in a wide variety of domains\nThe performance improvement with PSO included was immediately obvious.\nThe last thing that was needed was a name. GPU-Accelerated LocaL Optimisation and Particle swarm provides both a description of the algorithm and an acronym that gives a hat-tip to DASH. Perfect!"

This interactive figure shows a 2D slice through the hypersurface with all degrees of freedom set to their correct crystallographic values, apart from the fractional coordinates of the verapamil molecule along a and b, which form the axes plotted here.\n\n\nCode\n# This cell generates the Plotly html figure\nimport numpy as np\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport torch\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\ndisplay(HTML('''&lt;script src=\"/static/components/requirejs/require.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;'''))\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=False)\n\nnum = 151 # dimensionality of grid for the plot\nx = np.linspace(0,1,num)\ny = np.linspace(0,1,num)\n\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n\nif not os.path.exists(\"chisquared.csv\"):\n\n    from gallop.structure import Structure\n    from gallop import tensor_prep\n    from gallop import zm_to_cart\n    from gallop import intensities\n    from gallop import chi2\n    from gallop import files\n\n\n\n    struct = Structure(name=\"Verap\", ignore_H_atoms=True)\n    struct.add_data(\"./files/Verap.sdi\", source=\"DASH\")\n    struct.add_zmatrix(\"./files/CURHOM_1.zmatrix\", verbose=False)\n    struct.add_zmatrix(\"./files/CURHOM_2.zmatrix\", verbose=False)\n    struct.get_total_degrees_of_freedom(verbose=False)\n\n    # Coordinates of global minimum\n    g_external = np.array([0.68394345,0.45950916,-0.114383094,0.2456631,-0.29722878,\n                            -0.10422839,0.3358067,0.7402369,0.7596887,-0.16798618])\n\n    g_internal = np.array([-1.2276717,2.9165819,-0.96692395,-1.2034712,3.2261908,\n                            2.1036072,-3.2097023,-3.0328763,1.5661795,-0.0071008434,\n                            -0.1824131,-0.05715108,0.27950087])\n\n    global_min = np.hstack([g_external,g_internal])\n\n    vectors = np.zeros((2, struct.total_degrees_of_freedom)).astype(np.float32)\n    dims = (3,4) # This corresponds to verap along a, b\n    vectors[0][dims[0]] = 1\n    vectors[1][dims[1]] = 1\n\n    points = []\n    for x_point in x:\n        for y_point in y:\n            temp = np.copy(global_min)\n            temp[dims[0]] = 0\n            temp[dims[1]] = 0\n            points.append(temp + (vectors[0]*x_point) + (vectors[1]*y_point))\n\n    points = np.array(points)\n    external = points[:,:struct.total_external_degrees_of_freedom]\n    internal = points[:,struct.total_external_degrees_of_freedom:]\n\n    tensors = tensor_prep.get_all_required_tensors(struct, external=external,\n                                            internal=internal, requires_grad=False)\n\n    asymmetric_frac_coords = zm_to_cart.get_asymmetric_coords(**tensors[\"zm\"])\n\n    calculated_intensities = intensities.calculate_intensities(asymmetric_frac_coords,\n                                                         **tensors[\"int_tensors\"])\n\n    chisquared = chi2.calc_int_chisqd(calculated_intensities, **tensors[\"chisqd_tensors\"])\n\n    chisquared = chisquared.cpu().numpy()\n\n    np.savetxt(\"chisquared.csv\", chisquared, delimiter=\",\")\n\nelse:\n    df = pd.read_csv(\"chisquared.csv\", header=None)\n    chisquared = df.values\n\n# create figure\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add surface trace\nfig.add_trace(go.Surface(z=chisquared.reshape(xx.shape).T, x=x, y=y, colorscale=\"Inferno\"))\n\n# Update plot sizing\nfig.update_layout(\n    width=700,\n    height=600,\n    autosize=False,\n    margin=dict(t=0, b=0, l=0, r=0),\n    template=\"plotly_white\",\n)\n\n# Update 3D scene options\nfig.update_scenes(\n    aspectratio=dict(x=1, y=1, z=0.8),\n    aspectmode=\"manual\"\n)\n\n# Add dropdown\nfig.update_layout(\n    updatemenus=[\n        dict(\n            buttons=list([\n                dict(\n                    args=[\"type\", \"surface\"],\n                    label=\"3D Surface\",\n                    method=\"restyle\"\n                ),\n                dict(\n                    args=[\"type\", \"contour\"],\n                    label=\"Contour\",\n                    method=\"restyle\"\n                )\n            ]),\n            direction=\"down\",\n            pad={\"r\": 10, \"t\": 10},\n            showactive=True,\n            x=0.1,\n            xanchor=\"left\",\n            y=1.1,\n            yanchor=\"top\"\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n# Add annotation\nfig.update_layout(\n    annotations=[\n        dict(text=\"Plot type:\", showarrow=False,\n        x=0, y=1.085, yref=\"paper\", align=\"left\")\n    ],\n    xaxis=dict(\n        title='a',\n    ),\n    yaxis=dict(\n        title='b',\n    ),\n    scene_camera_eye=dict(x=-1, y=-3, z=0.9),\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nI’ll write another blog post in the future showing how to use the GALLOP code to generate plots like this.\nThere are several local minima present, each of which represents an incorrect structure that has either 21 or 22 of its 23 degrees of freedom correctly determined. Despite this, the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) at each local minimum gives no indication that the result is so close to correct. This means that even failed runs with high values of \\(\\chi^{2}\\) may be close to the global minimum. If we could accumulate and exploit this information to influence where the next set of local optimisations start, then it might be possible to save time in searching for the global minimum.\nWith this idea in mind, I tried a few things to attempt to recycle information from “failed” local optimisation attempts, including using kernel density estimation to try to resample various degrees of freedom depending based on the density of solutions that ended up with particular coordinates. This definitely showed an improvement relative to random sampling, but proved inconsistent in terms of the level of improvement obtained. Perhaps I’ll revisit this in a future blog post as I still think there’s something there that may be of use.\nEventually, I ended up trying particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to attempt to recycle the optimised positions. A few things attracted me to PSO: 1. It’s a simple algorithm to implement - just a few lines of code got it working as a proof of concept 2. The algorithm maintains a memory of “good” solutions so there’s less risk of the algorithm moving in a bad direction and getting stuck there 3. It’s shown great performance in a wide variety of domains\nThe performance improvement with PSO included was immediately obvious.\nThe last thing that was needed was a name. GPU-Accelerated LocaL Optimisation and Particle swarm provides both a description of the algorithm and an acronym that gives a hat-tip to DASH. Perfect!"

    "section": "Local optimisation",
    "text": "Local optimisation\nThe local optimisation algorithm used in GALLOP by default is Adam. This algorithm is very popular for training neural networks, and efficient implementations are available in almost every deep learning library.\nAdam incorporates two distinct innovations that improve its performance relative to (stochastic) gradient descent.\n\nAdam has a per-parameter adaptive step size in addition to a single global step size used for all parameters. This is useful as different degrees of freedom will have different effects on \\(\\chi^2\\) for the same percentage change in the parameter value. For example, the translation of a whole molecule within a unit cell affects the position of more scattering atoms than changing a torsion angle. What’s nice is that Adam automatically adjusts the step size for each parameter as it goes, meaning that a suitable step size is used throughout optimisation.\nAdam incorporates momentum, which helps it to escape shallow local minima, pass rapidly through flat regions of the hypersurface and dampens uncesessary oscillations in the optimisation trajectory. For an excellent overview of momentum (with a focus on ML applications), see this article: https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/\n\n\nAdam\nUsing the gradient obtained by automatic differentiation, \\(\\textbf{g}_t\\), Adam stores exponentially decaying averages of the gradients, \\(\\textbf{m}_t\\), and squared gradients, \\(\\textbf{v}_{t}\\), which are then used in conjunction with the overall step size, \\(\\alpha\\), to give a suitable step size for each parameter being optimised. The parameters \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) are numbers less than one that control the rate at which the past gradients and squared gradients respectively decay.\n\\[ \\textbf{m}_t = \\beta_{1} \\textbf{m}_{t-1} + (1-\\beta_{1})\\textbf{g}_t \\]\n\\[\\textbf{v}_t = \\beta_{2} \\textbf{v}_{t-1} + (1-\\beta_2)\\textbf{g}_t^2\\]\nBecause \\(\\textbf{m}_t\\) and \\(\\textbf{v}_{t}\\) are initialised as vectors of zeros, the authors of Adam use the following corrective terms to reduce the effect of this biasing, which can be particularly problematic in the early stages of optimisation:\n\\[ \\hat{\\textbf{m}}_t = \\frac{\\textbf{m}_t}{1-\\beta_1}\\]\n\\[ \\hat{\\textbf{v}}_t = \\frac{\\textbf{v}_t}{1-\\beta_2}\\]\nThese bias corrected terms are then used to update the parameters to be optimised, \\(\\textbf{x}_t\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is included to prevent numerical errors:\n\\[ \\textbf{x}_{t+1} = \\textbf{x}_t - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\hat{\\textbf{v}}_t} + \\epsilon}\\hat{\\textbf{m}}_t \\]\nThe authors of Adam suggest default parameters of \\(\\beta_1 = 0.9\\), \\(\\beta_2 = 0.999\\) and \\(\\epsilon = 1 \\times 10^{-8}\\). The step size, \\(\\alpha\\), must be set by the user. By default GALLOP sets \\(\\beta_2 = 0.9\\) which decays the past squared gradients more rapidly, and was found in our testing to be more effective than the default value.\n\n\nLearning rate finder\nTo make life easy for end users (and myself), I wanted a way to avoid having to experiment to find a suitable step size (\\(\\alpha\\)) to use in GALLOP.\nThe deep learning library, fast.ai includes a heuristic known as the learning rate finder, which is used to set the step size (referred to as the learning rate in ML-parlance) for deep learning experiments automatically. This is used in conjunction with a step-size alteration policy which is carried out during optimisation, as described here.\nAfter some testing and experimentation, GALLOP now makes use of a slightly modified version, as described below.\nA set of 200 log-linearly spaced learning rates are initialised, ranging from \\(1 \\times 10^{-4}\\) and \\(0.15\\). Starting with the smallest, GALLOP is run on the structure of interest, and the step size increased to the next value after every iteration. The sum of the \\(\\chi^2\\) values is recorded after each iteration, and subsequently plotted.\nThe minimum point on this plot, \\(\\alpha_{min}\\), is then used to give the step size. It may be scaled after considering the gradient of the line as the step size is increased beyond \\(\\alpha_{min}\\).\nTo do this, the step sizes and \\(\\chi^2\\) values are rescaled into the range 0-1. The x-axis is shifted such that \\(\\alpha_{min}\\) sits at 0, and the data plotted. If the gradient of the resultant curve (approximated by the red straight line below) is &gt; 0.5, then this is considered steep. A steep gradient implies a high sensitivity to the step size, and hence \\(\\alpha_{min}\\) is scaled by a factor of 0.5, i.e. GALLOP runs with a step size of \\(0.5\\alpha_{min}\\). A medium gradient (between 0.25 and 0.5) results in multiplication factor of 0.75, whilst a shallow gradient (less than 0.25) implies relative insensitivity to the step size, and hence results in a multiplication factor of 1.0.\nIn the GALLOP browser interface, this information is provided in a plot:\n\n\n\nStep size finder\n\n\nIn my testing, the learning rates obtained in this manner provide a good first attempt for GALLOP and provide reasonable performance over a wide variety of structures. However, this doesn’t mean that they are optimal, and if a structure isn’t solving, it might be worth looking at this parameter more closely. I tend to find that a learning rate of 0.03 - 0.05 tends to work well as a first attempt for most structures."

    "text": "Particle Swarm optimisation\nParticle Swarm Optimisation has previously been used in the context of SDPD in the program PeckCryst. The algorithm used in GALLOP is different to that used in PeckCryst in a number of ways which I’ll try to highlight below.\nThe equations for the PSO are simple. The velocity of a particle at step \\(t+1\\) \\((\\textbf{v}_{t+1})\\), is calculated from the velocity at the previous step \\((\\textbf{v}_{t})\\) and the position of the particle \\((\\textbf{x}_t)\\) using the following equation:\n\\[\\textbf{v}_{t+1} = \\omega_{t} \\textbf{v}_{t} + c_{1}\\textbf{R}_1(\\textbf{g}_{best} - \\textbf{x}_t) + c_2\\textbf{R}_2(\\textbf{x}_{best} - \\textbf{x}_t)\\]\nWhere \\(\\omega_{t}\\) is the inertia of the particle (which controls how much the previous velocity influences the next velocity) and \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) control the maximum step size in the direction of the best particle in the swarm \\((\\textbf{g}_{best})\\) and best position previously visited by the particle \\((\\textbf{x}_{best})\\) respectively. In contrast to PeckCryst which uses scalars, in GALLOP, by default \\(\\textbf{R}_1\\) and \\(\\textbf{R}_2\\) are diagonal matrices with their elements drawn independently from a standard uniform distribution. This provides more variability in how the particles move which helps to improve the exploration. In addition, the maximum absolute velocity in each direction in GALLOP is limited to 1.0.\nGALLOP calculates \\(\\omega\\) for particle \\(i\\) by ranking all of the \\(N\\) particles in the swarm in terms of their \\(\\chi^2\\) value, and the calculating their inertia using the following equation:\n\\[ \\omega_i = 0.4 + \\frac{Rank_i}{2N} \\]\nwhere \\(Rank_i\\) is the position of particle \\(i\\) in a sorted list of their respective \\(\\chi^2\\) values. This gives inertia values in the range 0.4 - 0.9, and means that the best particles slow down, whilst the worst particles in the swarm have higher inertias and hence are able to continue moving more rapidly towards (hopefully) promising areas of the hypersurface.\nThe degrees of freedom are then updated using the velocity and previous parameters according to:\n\\[\\textbf{x}_{t+1} = \\textbf{x}_t + \\textbf{v}_{t+1} \\]\nAnother difference to PeckCryst is the coordinate transform that is performed in GALLOP. The fractional coordinates are transformed to account for the repeating unit cell and the fact that coordinates of -0.1 and 0.9 are equivalent. The torsion angles are also transformed to ensure that the PSO treats angles of +180 and -180 degrees as equivalent. Molecular orientations, represented in GALLOP with quaternions, do not require any transformation. For local optimisation, the degrees of freedom that are optimised are:\n\\[ DoF_{(LO)} = [\\textbf{x}_{positions}, \\textbf{x}_{quaternions}, \\textbf{x}_{torsions}] \\]\nThese are then transformed as follows for use in the PSO:\n\\[ DoF_{(PSO)} = [\\sin{2\\pi\\textbf{x}_{positions}}, \\cos{2\\pi\\textbf{x}_{positions}}, \\textbf{x}_{quaternions}, \\sin{\\textbf{x}_{torsions}}, \\cos{\\textbf{x}_{torsions}}] \\]\nFollowing the PSO update, these are transformed back for use in LO using the two-argument arctangent function which gives values in the range \\(-\\pi\\) to \\(\\pi\\), which therefore necessitates additional scaling by a factor of \\(1/2\\pi\\) for the positions."

    "text": "Create a Structure object and add the data to it\nOur next job is to create a GALLOP structure object. The Structure class is used to store all of the information needed for the local optimisation procedure. We can specify a name for the Structure here, which will be used for any files we write out later (e.g. CIFs. We can also set the parameter that tells GALLOP to ignore the positions of hydrogen atoms during local optimisation. This significantly increases both the speed and the total number of particles that can be simulataneously evaluated, so only set this to False if you really need to!\n\nmystructure = Structure(name=\"VerapamilHCl\", ignore_H_atoms=True)\n\nNext up, we should add some diffraction data to our Structure object.\nCurrently, GALLOP accepts data that has been fitted by DASH, GSAS-II and TOPAS. In the future, I’m planning to add the ability to include SHELX-style data which may be of interest for those working with high-pressure single crystal diffraction data.\nWe need to tell the Structure object what program was used to fit the diffraction data so it knows what to look for: - If using diffraction data fitted by DASH, then we supply the filename for the .sdi and indicate that the source of the data is DASH - If using diffraction data fitted by GSAS-II, then we supply the filename for the .gpx and indicate that the source of the data is GSAS-II - If using diffraction data fitted by TOPAS, then we supply the filename for the .out and indicate that the source of the data is TOPAS\nWe can check that the data have been read in correctly by printing out the unit cell parameters and the first few peak intensities.\n\nmystructure.add_data(\"files/Verap.sdi\", source=\"DASH\")\n\nprint(\"Unit cell:\", mystructure.unit_cell)\nprint(\"Intensities 1-5:\",mystructure.intensities[:5])\n\nUnit cell: [  7.08991  10.59464  19.20684 100.1068   93.7396  101.561  ]\nIntensities 1-5: [ 85.705 235.032   0.614  -6.39  225.05 ]\n\n\nNext we need to add the Z-matrices to the structure object. The Z-matrices are expected to be in the format used by DASH. For more information on this format, see here.\nThis will automatically print out some information about the Z-matrices by default, though you can supply the argument verbose=False if you’d like to suppress that.\n\nmystructure.add_zmatrix(\"files/CURHOM_1.zmatrix\")\nmystructure.add_zmatrix(\"files/CURHOM_2.zmatrix\")\n\nAdded Z-matrix with Filename: files/CURHOM_1.zmatrix\nNon-H atoms: 1\nrefinable torsions: 0\nDegrees of freedom: 3\nAdded Z-matrix with Filename: files/CURHOM_2.zmatrix\nNon-H atoms: 33\nrefinable torsions: 13\nDegrees of freedom: 20 (7 + 13)\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the verapamil molecule is listed as having 20 degrees of freedom, with 7 external degrees of freedom and 13 torsions. The reason for the 7 in this case is because GALLOP makes use of quaternions to represent the molecular orientation. This gives an additional (redundant) degree of freedom relative to using Euler angles, and hence there are three parameters for the molecular position and four parameters for its orientation."

    "text": "Initialise a Particle Swarm\nNext thing we’ll need is a Particle Swarm optimiser. To do this, we initialise a Swarm object, and then use it to generate the initial external and internal degrees of freedom for our structure.\nWe need to specify the total number of particles, and how many swarms these should be divided into. Verapamil hydrochloride is relatively simple for GALLOP, so let’s go for 10,000 particles split into 10 swarms (i.e. 1000 particles per swarm).\n\nswarm = Swarm(mystructure, n_particles=10000, n_swarms=10)\n\nNow let’s use the swarm to generate the initial external and internal degrees of freedom. By default, this will use Latin hypercube sampling rather than uniform sampling as it gives a more even coverage of the hypersurface. If you want to use uniform sampling you can supply the argument method=\"uniform\" to the function below.\nWe can also include Mogul Distribution Bias information to this function if available, which will bias the initial torsion angles to match the distribution obtained in the CSD. This is accomplished by using DASH to create a DASH batch file (.dbf) which we supply as an additional argument, MDB=\"filename.dbf\".\n\nexternal, internal = swarm.get_initial_positions(method=\"latin\", MDB=None)\n\n100%|██████████| 10/10 [00:00&lt;00:00, 1534.63it/s]\n\n\nThe degrees of freedom are organised as follows: - External: 1. Position (x,y,z) for ZM 1 - N 2. Quaternions (q1,q2,q3,q4) for ZM 1 - N - Internal: 1. Torsion (t1,…,tn) for ZM 1 - N\nSo for verapamil hydrochloride, we have the following structure to the external DoFs: \\[[x_{Cl},y_{Cl},z_{Cl},x_{V},y_{V},z_{V},q1_{V},q2_{V},q3_{V},q4_{V}]\\]\nOnly the verapamil Z-matrix has any torsion angles, so all DoFs in the internal array correspond to verapamil torsons.\nLet’s plot a couple of these DoFs to ensure we have the expected even distribution. Positions are generated in the range [0,1]. Quaternions are generated in the range [-1,1] and torsions are generated in the range [\\(-\\pi\\), \\(\\pi\\)]. This is particularly useful if we are using MDB to ensure the resultant distribution matches that expected.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(12,4))\n\nax[0].hist(external[:,0], rwidth=0.7)\nax[0].set_title(\"Chloride $x$\")\nax[0].set_xlabel(\"Fractional coordinate\")\n\nax[1].hist(external[:,7], rwidth=0.7)\nax[1].set_title(\"Verapamil $q_2$\")\nax[1].set_xlabel(\"Quaternion\")\n\nax[2].hist(np.rad2deg(internal[:,0]), rwidth=0.7)\nax[2].set_title(\"Verapamil $\\\\tau_1$\")\nax[2].set_xlabel(\"Torsion angle\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are reassuringly boring plots!"

In some cases, you may wish to try solving with fewer reflections than are available in your dataset (perhaps in order to reduce GPU memory use). In such a scenario, you can set the number of reflections to use by modifying the ‘n_reflections’ dictionary value. You can find out about what the other parameters do in the docstring for the gallop.optim.local.minimise() function.\nHere, we’ll stick with the default values, which will use all reflections available in the data, the Adam optimiser, will run for 500 local optimisation iterations and will automatically save a CIF of the best structure found after each iteration.\nOur next task will be to find a reasonable learning rate using the learning rate finder.

The multiplication factor which scales the best learning rate found 4. The scaled learning rate - we can use this directly, by setting:\nminimiser_settings[\"learning_rate\"] = learning_rate[3]\nHowever, let’s do the scaling process ourselves to see what it looks like.\n\n\nCode\nlrs = learning_rate[0].copy()\nlosses = learning_rate[1].copy()\nmultiplication_factor = learning_rate[2]\nlearning_rate_to_use = learning_rate[3]\n\nlrs -= lrs.min()\nlrs /= lrs.max()\n\nlosses -= losses.min()\nlosses /= losses.max()\n\nminpoint = np.argmin(losses)\n\nplt.plot(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min(),\n    lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min(),\":\",alpha=0.5,c=\"k\")\nplt.plot(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min(),\n    0.5*(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min()),\"-.\",\n    alpha=0.5,c=\"k\")\nplt.plot(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min(),\n    0.25*(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min()),\"--\",\n    alpha=0.5,c=\"k\")\nplt.plot(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min(),\n                            losses[minpoint:])\ngradient = ((losses[-1] - losses[minpoint])\n            / (lrs[-1] - lrs[minpoint]))\nplt.plot(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min(),\n            gradient*(lrs[minpoint:]-lrs[minpoint:].min()),\n            c=\"r\")\nplt.xlabel('normalised learning rate')\nplt.ylabel('rescaled sum')\nplt.legend([\"y=x\",\"y=0.5x\",\"y=0.25x\",\"rescaled sum\", \"approx\"],\n                loc=2, prop={'size': 8})\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the gradient of the red line approximating the blue curve is fairly shallow - less than 0.25. As a result, this tells us that this particular structure is relatively insensitive to the learning rate, so we can use a relatively large learning rate and still expect good performance.\nTherefore, we use a multiplication factor of 1.0, meaning that our learning rate will be \\(1.0 \\times \\alpha_{min}\\) where \\(\\alpha_{min}\\) is the learning rate corresponding to the minimum point on the curve in the previous plot.\n\nbest_learning_rate = learning_rate[0][minpoint]\n\nminimiser_settings[\"learning_rate\"] = best_learning_rate"

The interactive plot below allows you to explore the distribution of optimised positions for each combination of the degrees of freedom. As you can see, the optimised particles tend to cluster around specific combinations of values - this isn’t too surprising. Once a swarm has located the global minimum, all of the other particles in the swarm will begin to move in that direction causing large numbers of particles to have very similar degrees of freedom after a few additional iterations.\nNote that due to a quirk of the library I’m using to generate the plots and interactive widget, the first plot you see is the x-coordinate of the chloride ion plotted against itself. This effectively gives a diagonal line which is equivalent to a histogram of the chloride x-coordinate distribution.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode\n\ndisplay(HTML('''&lt;script src=\"/static/components/requirejs/require.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;'''))\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=False)\n\n# Combine all the DoFs into a single DataFrame.\nall_df = pd.DataFrame(np.hstack([result[\"external\"], result[\"internal\"]]))\n\n# Label the columns so we know what each one is.\nall_df.columns=[\"x_cl\",\"y_cl\",\"z_cl\",\n                \"x_v\",\"y_v\",\"z_v\",\n                \"q1\",\"q2\",\"q3\",\"q4\",\n                \"t1\",\"t2\",\"t3\",\"t4\",\"t5\",\"t6\",\"t7\",\n                \"t8\",\"t9\",\"t10\",\"t11\",\"t12\",\"t13\"]\n\npositions = [\"x_cl\",\"y_cl\",\"z_cl\",\"x_v\",\"y_v\",\"z_v\"]\nquaternions = [\"q1\",\"q2\",\"q3\",\"q4\"]\ntorsions = [\"t1\",\"t2\",\"t3\",\"t4\",\"t5\",\"t6\",\"t7\",\n            \"t8\",\"t9\",\"t10\",\"t11\",\"t12\",\"t13\"]\n\n# Normalise the data so everything sits in its expected range.\n# Positions into range 0-1, quaternions set to be unit quaternions and torsions\n# into range -180 to 180.\nall_df[positions] = all_df[positions] % 1\nall_df[quaternions] /= np.sqrt(\n                    (all_df[quaternions]**2).sum(axis=1).values.reshape(-1,1))\n\nall_df[torsions] = np.rad2deg(np.arctan2(np.sin(all_df[torsions]),\n                            np.cos(all_df[torsions])))\n\n# Now generate the figure\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# We'll use a histogram2dContour plot\nfig.add_trace(go.Histogram2dContour(\n        x=all_df[\"x_cl\"],\n        y=all_df[\"x_cl\"],\n        colorscale = 'Viridis',\n        contours_showlabels = False,\n        nbinsx=10,\n        nbinsy=10,\n        ncontours=20,\n    ))\n\n# Add the drop-down menus for selecting the data to plot\nbutton_list_x = []\nbutton_list_y = []\nfor dof in all_df.columns:\n    button_list_x.append(dict(\n                    args=[\"x\", [all_df[dof].values]],\n                    label=dof,\n                    method=\"restyle\"\n                ))\n    button_list_y.append(dict(\n                    args=[\"y\", [all_df[dof].values]],\n                    label=dof,\n                    method=\"restyle\"\n                ))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    updatemenus=[\n        dict(\n            buttons=button_list_x,\n            direction=\"up\",\n            pad={\"r\": 10, \"t\": 10},\n            showactive=True,\n            x=0.45,\n            xanchor=\"left\",\n            y=-.05,\n            yanchor=\"top\"\n        ),\n        dict(\n            buttons=button_list_y,\n            direction=\"down\",\n            pad={\"r\": 10, \"t\": 10},\n            showactive=True,\n            x=-0.18,\n            xanchor=\"left\",\n            y=.95,\n            yanchor=\"top\"\n        ),\n    ]\n)\n\n# Add the annotations to label the drop-down menus\nfig.update_layout(\n    annotations=[\n        dict(text=\"x axis\", x=0.52, xref=\"paper\", y=-.07, yref=\"paper\",\n                            align=\"left\", showarrow=False),\n        dict(text=\"y axis\", x=-.15, xref=\"paper\", y=.98,\n                            yref=\"paper\", showarrow=False),\n    ])\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    width=700,\n    height=700,\n    autosize=False,\n    margin=dict(t=100, b=0, l=0, r=0),\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nLet’s compare one of these, say for example the x coordinate for the verapamil molecule and the y coordinate of the chloride ion, and see what the distribution looks like if we include or exclude particles with low values of \\(\\chi^2\\) from consideration.\n\n\nCode\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nxaxis = \"x_v\"\nyaxis = \"y_cl\"\nlimit = 400\nn_low = (result[\"chi_2\"]&lt;=limit).sum()\nn_high = (result[\"chi_2\"]&gt;limit).sum()\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(18,6))\n\nsns.kdeplot(ax=ax[0], x=all_df[xaxis], y=all_df[yaxis],)\nax[0].set_title(\"All particles\")\n\nsns.kdeplot(ax=ax[1], x=all_df[xaxis][result[\"chi_2\"]&lt;=limit], y=all_df[yaxis][result[\"chi_2\"]&lt;=limit],)\nax[1].set_title(f\"{n_low} particles with $\\\\chi^2 \\\\leq {limit}$\")\n\nsns.kdeplot(ax=ax[2], x=all_df[xaxis][result[\"chi_2\"]&gt;limit], y=all_df[yaxis][result[\"chi_2\"]&gt;limit],)\nax[2].set_title(f\"{n_high} particles with $\\\\chi^2 &gt; {limit}$\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the particles with higher \\(\\chi^2\\) values are not as tightly clustered as those with low \\(\\chi^2\\) values, and are therefore it’s less likely that their swarms are stuck in deep minima.

    "text": "In this post, we’ll be using the GALLOP Python API to to enable us to visualise \\(\\chi^2\\) hypersurfaces. These hypersurfaces are functions of the molecular positions, orientations and conformations within the unit cell. As such, their dimensionality is typically high, meaning that we cant visualise them directly. However, we can visualise low-dimensional slices through them. We’ve seen an example of one of these slices an earlier post.\nWe’ll write a simple function that allows us to specify two or three vector directions, then sample \\(\\chi^2\\) at points on a grid between these directions. We’ll also have a go at visualising the trajectories taken by particles initialised at each point on the grid as they are optimised with Adam, the default local optimiser in GALLOP.\nFor ease, we’ll continue using verapamil hydrochloride as our structure of interest. You can download the DASH fit files and Z-matrices I’ll be using here.\n\n\n\n\nUsually when we are trying to solve the crystal structure of an unknown small molecule, we are most concerned with finding the global minimum of the \\(\\chi^2\\) hypersurface. Therefore, we’ll start off investigating the region around the global minimum. Due to the repeating nature of a crystallographic lattice, and symmetries within unit cells, there are infinitely many points that correspond to the global minimum of the hypersurface - therefore, the coordinates below may not be the same as coordinates you obtain in your own solutions of verapamil hydrochloride.\nWhen GALLOP is used to solve a crystal structure, the degrees of freedom corresponding to the solution are automatically added to the CIF as comments. For example, here is the header of a CIF for verapamil hydrochloride:\n# Generated using pymatgen and GALLOP\n# GALLOP External Coords = [0.68394345,0.45950916,-0.114383094,0.2456631,-0.29722878,-0.10422839,0.3358067,0.7402369,0.7596887,-0.16798618\n# GALLOP Internal Coords = -1.2276717,2.9165819,-0.96692395,-1.2034712,3.2261908,2.1036072,-3.2097023,-3.0328763,1.5661795,-0.0071008434,-0.1824131,-0.05715108,0.27950087\n# Profile chisqd = 16.741\ndata_Verap_0006_56.244_chisqd_252_refs_3.6_mins.cif\nSo as long as we’ve been able to solve the crystal structure of interest with GALLOP, we’ll have easy access to the coordinates of a global minimum point.\nWe can also plot around a random point on the hypersurface to give a comparison.\n\n\n\nIn this post, we’ll look at two options for plotting. The first and most obvious will be to plot along some of the degrees of freedom in the structure to see how they interact.\nThe other option will be to choose random unit vectors and slice the surface along them to get a feel for how all of the degrees of freedom interact. In high dimensional spaces, randomly generated pairs of vectors will be approximately orthogonal so it should be possible to get reasonable levels of independence between the axes in our plots."

The upper plot in each case shows the trajectories if all of the degrees of freedom other than those being plotted are fixed. The lower plot shows the trajectories taken if everything is allowed to refine (as would be normal in GALLOP).\nThe plots might appear a little small on the blog - if you want larger views, right click on the image and open them in a new tab.\n\n\nCode\ndims=(3,4)\nprint(dims,\"others fixed\")\nfixed_trajectories_34 = plot_trajectories(mystructure, dims, np.copy(global_min), lr=0.01, fix=True, n_iterations=100, n_points=50)\n\nprint(dims, \"others free\")\nfree_trajectories_34 = plot_trajectories(mystructure, dims, np.copy(global_min), lr=0.01, fix=False, n_iterations=100, n_points=50)\n\ndims=(10,11)\nprint(dims,\"others fixed\")\nfixed_trajectories_1011 = plot_trajectories(mystructure, dims, np.copy(global_min), lr=0.01, fix=True, n_iterations=100, n_points=50)\n\nprint(dims, \"others free\")\nfree_trajectories_1011 = plot_trajectories(mystructure, dims, np.copy(global_min), lr=0.01, fix=False, n_iterations=100, n_points=50)\n\n\n(3, 4) others fixed\n\n\n\n\n\n(3, 4) others free\n\n\n\n\n\n(10, 11) others fixed\n\n\n\n\n\n(10, 11) others free\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, as we allow the other degrees of freedom to refine, we end up with different behaviour. In the example of the fractional coordinates (dims = 3,4) can now see two points within the unit cell that constitute a global minimum after refinement - this is because in the second plot, the chloride ion is free to move to accommodate the different positions of the verapamil molecule.\nAnother point of interest is the effects of momentum in the Adam optimiser are clearly visible - the trajectories in some cases backtrack after moving in a particular direction for a while. This is because momentum has carried them “uphill”. This property can allow the local optimisation algorithm in GALLOP to escape shallow local minima, as well as pass quickly through flat regions of the hypersurface.\nLastly, let’s animate the trajectories!\n\n\nCode\nfrom matplotlib import animation\n\ndef generate_animation(coords, chi2s, grid, gridpoints, name=\"fig.gif\", type=\"frac\"):\n    # First set up the figure, the axis, and the plot element we want to animate\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\n    ax = plt.axes(xlim=(gridpoints[0].min(), gridpoints[0].max()),\n                ylim=(gridpoints[1].min(), gridpoints[1].max()))\n\n    ax.contour(gridpoints[0], gridpoints[1], chi2s[0].reshape(grid[0].shape), cmap=\"viridis\", levels=20)\n\n    scatter = ax.scatter(coords.T[0, 0, :], coords.T[0, 1, :], c=chi2s[-1],\n                        s=5, alpha=0.25)\n\n\n    # animation function.  This is called sequentially\n    def animate(i, coords, chi2s):\n        #scatter.set_offsets(coords.T[i, :, :].T)\n        if type == \"frac\":\n            scatter.set_offsets(coords.T[i, :, :].T % 1)\n        elif type == \"torsion\":\n            scatter.set_offsets(np.arctan2(np.sin(coords.T[i, :, :].T), np.cos(coords.T[i, :, :].T)))\n        #scatter.set_array(chi2s[i])\n        scatter.set_array(chi2s[-1])\n        return scatter,\n\n\n    ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=range(coords.T.shape[0]), blit=True,\n                                    fargs=(coords, chi2s), interval=100,)\n\n    ani.save(name)\n    #plt.show()\n    return None\n\ngenerate_animation(*fixed_trajectories_34, name=\"images/animation_34.gif\", type=\"frac\")\ngenerate_animation(*fixed_trajectories_1011, name=\"images/animation_1011.gif\", type=\"torsion\")\n\n\nVerapamil along a and b \nVerapamil torsion 1 and 2 \nThings seem to move much more slowly in the torsion angle example - I suspect this is because the gradient on the “flat” region is low enough that it takes a while for the particles to pick up speed!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "An article published in 2001 by D. W. M. Hofmann describes how crystallographic databases can be used to derive the average volume occupied by atoms of each element in crystal structures. Using his tabulated values, it’s possible to rapidly estimate the volume occupied by a given molecule, and use this to aid indexing of powder diffraction data. This is particularly useful for laboratory diffraction data, which is generally associated with lower figures of merit such as de Wolff’s \\(M_{20}\\) and Smith and Snyder’s \\(F_N\\), which can make discriminating between alternative options more challenging. Other volume estimation methods, notably the 18 Å³ rule are also commonly used, though Hofmann’s volumes give generally more accurate results.\nI’ve put together a freely available web-app, HofCalc, which can be used to conveniently obtain these estimates. It should display reasonably well on mobile devices as well as PCs/laptops. You can access it at the following address:\nhttps://hofcalc.onrender.com\n\nThis post will explain how it works, and will look at some examples of how it can be used in practice. I’m grateful to Norman Shankland who provided invaluable feedback and assistance with debugging of the app."

Users that don’t have local access to GPUs, or who want to gain access to faster GPUs without needing to purchase their own can make use of cloud computing resources. In this post we’ll look at how to set up a GPU-equipped virtual machine on Google’s Compute Engine cloud service, and then use it to run GALLOP jobs both through the graphical browser-based interface and via python mode.\nOne feature offered by GCE is preemptible instances, which significantly lowers the cost of using resources. There are some limitations that come with this, but they are usually not a concern for GALLOP jobs that take &lt; 24 hours to complete. It’s also worth noting that new customers to Google Cloud get $300 free credits to try out their services, so it’s well worth having a go. You will need a credit/debit card to gain access to GPUs even though you won’t be charged until the free credits run out. You will also need to request an increase to your GPU quota before they can be used - this only took a few minutes to be approved for me.\nLastly, I’m not sponsored or endorsed by Google at all, I just like this service. There are many other cloud GPU providers who may be worth a look to see if they suit your requirements. If you know of any good ones, please get in contact with me, especially if you want to help with providing instructions for other users."

    "text": "The correlated integrated intensity \\(\\chi^2\\) figure of merit has been shown to be equivalent to the profile \\(\\chi^2\\), but is more efficient to calculate in CPU-based code. This is due to the sparsity of the inverse covariance matrix (typically only 1-5% of the elements will be non-zero if using DASH’s 20% correlation cut-off), which means that only a small number of non-zero elements need to be multiplied and summed. Code that exploits this property can therefore obtain very high performance - this is the approach embodied in the fortran code used in DASH.\nThe intensity \\(\\chi^2\\) figure of merit in GALLOP does not exploit the sparsity of the inverse covariance matrix; instead the matrix is treated as dense and a full matrix multiplication is performed. This is because very fast matrix multiplication routines which make effective use of the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs are available in cuBLAS. Sparse matrices are currently less well supported, and though there has been a lot of progress, performance remains generally worse.\nThis got me thinking: given that we aren’t currently able to make best use of the sparsity of the inverse covariance matrix in GALLOP and instead treat it as a dense matrix, can the profile \\(\\chi^2\\) also be implemented in a manner that is amenable to GPU acceleration, and if so, how does the performance compare to the intensity \\(\\chi^2\\) figure of merit that is currently used?\nTo tackle this, we’ll take a look at the output files produced by DASH during its Pawley fitting procedure, and work out how the full profile can be (rapidly) reconstructed."

The intensities in the baseline_peaks array have been scaled to correct for peak multiplicity, Lorentz polarisation factor and form-factor fall off and then divided by their Pawley extracted intensity.\nThis then allows the calculated profile to be rapidly reconstructed by multiplying each of the rows in the baseline_peaks array by the corresponding intensity (i.e. intensities calculated during SDPD or the Pawley extracted intensities), then summing each column in the array to account for intensity contribution from multiple peaks. The profile \\(\\chi^2\\) can then be calculated from the reconstructed profile.\nLet’s have a go at reconstructing the profile from the Pawley-refined intensities:\n\n\nCode\nfrom gallop.structure import Structure\n\nmystructure = Structure(name=\"verapamil_hydrochloride\")\nmystructure.add_data(\"verap.sdi\", source=\"DASH\")\n\n# Here we reconstruct the profile by multiplying by the Pawley intensities, then summing each column\ncalc_profile = (mystructure.intensities.reshape(-1,1) * baseline_peaks).sum(axis=0)\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.plot(profile[:,0], profile[:,1])\nplt.plot(profile[:,0], calc_profile)\nplt.legend([\"Obs\", \"Calc\"])\nplt.xlabel(\"$2\\\\theta$\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Intensity\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we use intensities calculated during SDPD with GALLOP then we will need to scale the calculated pattern in order to properly calculate the \\(\\chi^2\\) value. We calculate the scaling factor using the equation below:\n\\[ c = \\frac{\\sum{y_i^{obs}}}{\\sum{y_i^{calc}}} \\]\nThis will then allow us calculate the profile \\(\\chi^2\\) value, via:\n\\[ \\chi^2_{profile} = \\frac{\\sum{\\frac{(cy^{calc}_i - y^{obs}_i)^2}{(\\sigma_i^{obs})^2}}}{N - P + C} \\]\nwhere \\(N\\) = the total number of observations (i.e. points in the profile), \\(P\\) = the number of parameters refined and \\(C\\) is the number of constraints used in the refinement. For the \\(\\chi^2\\) calculation, we will by default consider only the points which have at least one Bragg peak contributing to the intensity of that point as recommended here (pdf).\n\n\nCode\n# Generate a mask that selects only the points containing contributions from at least one Bragg peak\nsubset = n_contributing_peaks &gt; 0\n\n# Calculate the calculated pattern scaling factor\nscale = profile[:,1][subset].sum() / calc_profile[subset].sum()\n\n# The \"-2\" in the denominator is because DASH refines two background terms during the Pawley refinement by default\nprof_chisquared = ((scale*calc_profile[subset] - profile[:,1][subset])**2 / profile[:,2][subset]**2).sum() / (calc_profile[subset].shape[0] - 2)\nprint(\"Profile chi-squared =\",prof_chisquared)\n\n\nProfile chi-squared = 3.5833747277018166"

However, whilst providing a potentially straightforward solution to the ring conformation issue, such conformer generators frequently produce multiple alternative conformations, and despite much progress, often still have difficulty in reproducing sensible macrocyclic ring conformations. This can result in a large number of candidate molecular models that must be tested, with no guarantee that any of them are sufficiently close to the true conformation to obtain a solution from which subsequent Rietveld/DFT refinement could reasonably proceed."

Use of an alternative molecular descriptor based on the Cartesian coordinates of each atom, with restraints applied to enforce the molecular geometry 2. Use of molecular dynamics routines which allow the ring conformation to be adjusted during the SDPD procedure whilst maintaining the internal coordinate description\nBoth of these methods have been shown to work effectively. In the former, the huge increase in degrees of freedom relative to an internal coordinate based molecular descriptor is counteracted by the addition of restraints. These restrict the allowable combinations of values of the degrees of freedom to only those that maintain the molecular geometry. Where this approach doesn’t give solutions rapidly, the second approach using molecualar dynamics routines can be employed, though the computational cost of their inclusion results in run times that are approximately double that of a pure GO approach."

    "section": "Ring breaking",
    "text": "Ring breaking\nA less commonly employed approach is to keep the Z-matrix representation, but break one of the bonds in the ring in order to convert the ring into a flexible chain of atoms. This then allows the standard Z-matrix representation to be used to refine the torsion angles within the ring.\n\n\n\nSide by side of unbroken and broken macrocycle\n\n\nHowever, this clearly comes at the expense of increasing the number of degrees of freedom which must be determined. In the figure above, we go from 8 degrees of freedom on the left (3 position, 3 orientation, 2 torsions) to 20 degrees of freedom on the right (3 position, 3 orientation, 14 torsions) - this is a pretty hefty increase!\nSo, what can we do about this? Well, the bond we broke to allow the ring conformation to adjust still exists in reality! We can therefore use a restraint that forces the distance between the atoms either side of the broken bond to be equal to the known bond length. This restraint places limits on the values that can be taken by the additional degrees of freedom to only those that reform the ring, whilst allowing any ring conformation to be adopted. The idea of using restraints to counteract the increase in the number of degrees of freedom forms the basis of our approach.\nWe were not the first people by any means to make use of restraints in this context - see for example a recent article from the Bari group who used EXPO to do essentially the same thing (incidentally, this was published after we submitted our first version of our article to CEC, so the timing is a complete coincidence). However, I think our work still provides some new insights. Firstly, the combined use of bond breaking and restraints is not limited in applicability to ring systems - all sorts of other problems could be tackled more efficiently using this method (discussed more later in this post). Secondly, we also show that GALLOP continues to provide extremely impressive performance - even with the large numbers of degrees of freedom that bond breaking introduces; results are typically obtained in tens of minutes rather than tens of hours or days!"

In the GALLOP code, the cosine of the user supplied angle is calculated and stored in advance for efficiency. The penalty term is bounded to values in the range 0 to 4 (inclusive)."

    "text": "Cost function and restraint weighting\nDue to the generally small values of the restraint penalty terms relative to typical SDPD \\(\\chi^2\\) values, we need to weight the penalty terms so that their magnitude is sufficient to have a meaningful impact on the optimisation process. The approach that I ended up going with is to scale all of the penalty terms by the value of \\(\\chi^2\\) at every iteration so that their numerical values are comparable. I’ve also made it possible to further set the relative importance of each individual restraint by allowing users to set their own weights for each restraint. A weight of 1 indicates that the restraint has equal importance to \\(\\chi^2\\), weights less than or greater than 1 therefore enable the relative importance to be down- or up-weighted respectivly.\nOne thing that took me a little while to work out when I was implementing this (in retrospect this was an obvious thing I should have considered!) is that it’s not OK to just multiply the tensor of penalty terms by the tensor of \\(\\chi^2\\) values. To see why, let’s say that we have a structure with \\(a\\) distance restraints, \\(b\\) angle restraints and \\(c\\) torsion restraints (and their associated weights, \\(w_a\\), \\(w_b\\), and \\(w_c\\)). Let’s define the cost function that the local optimiser is trying to minimise as:\n\\[ C(\\textbf{x}) = \\chi^2(\\textbf{x}) + \\chi^2(\\textbf{x})\\left(\\sum_a w_a{D(\\textbf{x})} + \\sum_b{w_bA(\\textbf{x})} + \\sum_c{w_cT(\\textbf{x})}\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(\\textbf{x}\\) represents the structural degrees of freedom. Let’s simplify this using \\(R\\) to represent the sum of all the weighted penalty terms:\n\\[ C(\\textbf{x}) = \\chi^2(\\textbf{x})(1 + R(\\textbf{x})) \\]\nBy the product rule, the gradient of this function is:\n\\[ \\nabla C(\\textbf{x}) = (1 + R(\\textbf{x}))\\nabla \\chi^2(\\textbf{x}) + \\chi^2(\\textbf{x})\\nabla R(\\textbf{x}) \\]\nWe can see that this could lead to problems because of the scaling of the gradient of \\(\\chi^2\\) by a factor of \\(1 + R(\\textbf{x})\\). In my testing this led to some very strange runs where it looked like progress was being made but then the optimisation behaviour resulted in strange oscillations in the value of \\(\\chi^2\\) and failure to obtain a solution on even simple problems.\nThe solution I landed on is to make a gradient-free copy of the \\(\\chi^2\\) tensor, i.e. a copy that is not a function of the degrees of freedom which can act purely as a numerical scaling factor. This converts the cost function into:\n\\[ C(\\textbf{x}) = \\chi^2(\\textbf{x}) + \\chi^2_{copy}\\left(\\sum_a w_a{D(\\textbf{x})} + \\sum_b{w_bA(\\textbf{x})} + \\sum_c{w_cT(\\textbf{x})}\\right) = \\chi^2(\\textbf{x}) + \\chi^2_{copy}R(\\textbf{x})) \\]\nand hence the gradient into:\n\\[ \\nabla C(\\textbf{x}) = \\nabla \\chi^2(\\textbf{x}) + \\chi^2_{copy} \\nabla R(\\textbf{x}) \\]\nThis gives the optimisation behaviour that was expected and desired! In pytorch (the library used by GALLOP to perform the automatic differentiation), it’s very easy to make the required gradient-free copy of the \\(\\chi^2\\) tensor:\nchisquared_copy = chisquared.detach().clone()\nThe .detach() method means that the computational graph associated with the tensor is removed, thus removing the dependence on the degrees of freedom. The .clone() method then copies the contents into the new tensor which can then act purely as a scaling factor."

I then save the structure as a .mol2 file, which can then be used with DASH to generate a Z-matrix. Occasionally, there’ll be issues with the resultant Z-matrices using hydrogen atoms to define rotatable torsions. In such cases, I recommend deleting all hydrogen atoms prior to saving the mol2, then regenerating the Z-matrices. The hydrogen atoms can be added back in once the structure has solved.\nAs our example, we’ll use the structure with CSD refcode IJUXUI, a Schiff base with a 17-membered macrocyclic ring. Diffraction data and the structure can be downloaded here - I’m not sure if I can rehost the data here, but if you would like a copy of my fit files and models, feel free to message me and I’ll send them over.\nI opened the CSD entry for IJUXUI in Mercury and deleted the bond between O2 and C8. I also converted the two C=N double bonds into single bonds, and ended up with the following model, shown here with the atom labels involved with the cut bonds and restricted torsion angles, and hydrogen atoms hidden for clarity.\n\n\n\nIJUXUI cut model\n\n\nWe are going to use the following restraints for our runs:\n\nDistance restraint between O2 and C8, set to 1.44 Å\nTorsion angle restraint using atoms C3, C12, N1 and C13 set to \\(180 \\degree\\)\nTorsion angle restraint using atoms C18, C17, N2 and C16 set to \\(180 \\degree\\)\n\n\nGALLOP Learning rate\nOne thing I have found is that the learning rate finder built into GALLOP doesn’t work as well when there are restraints in play, so my recommendation is to use the learning rate finder as normal with either a cut or a non-cut model, then use the learning rate obtained there when the restraints are active. A bit of experimentation might be needed to get a reasonable learning rate, however, as a general rule I choose the larger of the two value obtained.\nFor my fit files and the un-cut model, I obtained a learning rate of 0.0325, which I’ll be using for the rest of this work."

    "text": "Browser interface\nStart the GALLOP browser interface as normal (I’m using Kaggle, so my jobs are running on a P100 GPU), then upload the files needed. Modify the number of swarms and number of particles per swarm as you see fit, then we’ll need to tweak a couple of settings. You may also wish to reduce the total number of iterations as this structure will solve very quickly - 5 GALLOP iterations with 10 swarms of 1000 particles should be more than sufficient.\nLearning rate - open the Local Optimiser settings, then select “Show advanced options”. Scroll down until you see “Find learning rate”, and unselect that box. A new number input widget will appear, in here, set the learning rate to 0.0325 (or whatever value you obtain with your fit files). When you press enter, the display may show “0.03”, but rest assured that the additional decimal places are still recorded internally - not that they make much difference in practice!\n\nRestraints - continue scrolling down the advanced local optimiser settings, until you see check boxes for restraints:\n\nWe’ll be using both distance and torsion restraints, so select these. New input widgets will appear as a result:\n\nFor the distance restraint, we only need one, so all we need to do is specify the atoms involved, the distance value we want to use, and the weight to apply to this restraint - we’ll use a weight of 1.0:\nFor the torsion restraints, we’ll need two of these, so we modify the number of restraints to 2, and then the boxes allow us to specify each one:\n\nAs a brief aside, even though we aren’t using them in this case, it’s worth talking about using angle restraints in the browser interface. As GALLOP allows the flexibility to specify angle restraints between any two interatomic vectors, we can either supply 3 or 4 atom labels depending on what we want to do. For normal bond angles, we only provide three atom labels. For example, if we want the angle C2 - C1 - C3 (i.e. atom C1 in the middle) to be restrained to 120 degrees with a weight of 1.0, we would enter the following into the widget:\nC2,C1,C3,120,1.0\nAlternatively, if we have two interatomic vectors, for example C1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C2 and C3 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C4, and we want them to be perpendicular with a weight of 0.5, we would use the following input:\nC1,C2,C3,C4,90,0.5\n\nRunning GALLOP\nOnce the restraints and other settings have been entered, we’re good to go! Start GALLOP as normal. On this structure with a P100 GPU accessed via Kaggle, this process took less than 3 minutes to complete:\n\nOne thing that GALLOP allows is to save animations of the trajectory taken by each particle. This option slows things down a fair bit, but does produce some cool animations! Click this link for an interactive animation (move, zoom etc using mouse) of the trajectory taken by the best performing particle during the first iteration of a different set of runs, with hydrogen atoms hidden for clarity. On the left, you see the whole unit cell, with the asymmetric unit shown on the right. You can see that the ring very rapidly reforms due to the action of the distance restraint.\nNote: an earlier version of this blog post had the animation embedded, but I found it runs fairly slowly on old hardware so it’s now accessible via the link above\nThe “shaking” that we see is due to the high learning rate in the middle of the local optimisation process, as per the 1-cycle learning rate policy used in GALLOP by default. This causes some oscillation due to the larger step sizes taken in the middle of the run."

If you’re running this notebook yourself on Colab or Kaggle, you’ll need to install GALLOP first by uncommenting the code cell below (hidden on blog).\nAs usual, we start with our library imports and creating a structure object. We then use the structure methods read in the diffraction data and add Z-matrices. For a more detailed overview of using the Python API, see this post.\n\n\nCode\n# Uncomment the line below, then run this cell to install GALLOP on Colab or Kaggle\n#!git clone https://github.com/mspillman/gallop.git && cd gallop && pip install .\n\n\n\nfrom gallop.structure import Structure\nfrom gallop.optim import local\nfrom gallop.optim import Swarm\n\nmystructure = Structure(name=\"IJUXUI_cut_with_restraints\", ignore_H_atoms=True)\nmystructure.add_data(\"files/IJUXUI.sdi\", source=\"DASH\")\nmystructure.add_zmatrix(\"files/IJUXUI_cut_1.zmatrix\")\n\nAdded Z-matrix with Filename: files/IJUXUI_cut_1.zmatrix\nNon-H atoms: 29\nrefinable torsions: 14\nDegrees of freedom: 21 (7 + 14)\n\n\nNow let’s add the restraints. The below code cell shows how to do this using the unique atom-label approach that was also used in the browser interface - we pass a dictionary to the function containing key/value pairs corresponding to the atom labels, the desired value for the distance/angle/torsion and the weight for the restraint.\n\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\" : \"distance\",\n                        \"atom1\" : \"O2\",\n                        \"atom2\" : \"C8\",\n                        \"value\" : 1.44,\n                        \"weight\" : 1.0})\n\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\" : \"torsion\",\n                        \"atom1\" : \"C3\",\n                        \"atom2\" : \"C12\",\n                        \"atom3\" : \"N1\",\n                        \"atom4\" : \"C13\",\n                        \"value\" : 180.0,\n                        \"weight\" : 1.0})\n\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\" : \"torsion\",\n                        \"atom1\" : \"C18\",\n                        \"atom2\" : \"C17\",\n                        \"atom3\" : \"N2\",\n                        \"atom4\" : \"C16\",\n                        \"value\" : 180.0,\n                        \"weight\" : 1.0})\n\n\nAngle restraints\nWhilst we aren’t using them here, for an angle restraint, we need to specify two interatomic vectors. If we want this to be a standard bond angle, then atom1 and atom3 need to be the same atom, for example, in a structure where the angle C2 - C1 - C3 is 120 degrees, then we want the angle between the vectors C1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C2 and C1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C3 to be 120 degrees, so we would use the following command:\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\" : \"angle\",\n                        \"atom1\" : \"C1\",\n                        \"atom2\" : \"C2\",\n                        \"atom3\" : \"C1\",\n                        \"atom4\" : \"C3\",\n                        \"value\" : 120.0,\n                        \"weight\" : 1.0})\nIf we weren’t working with a normal bond angle, then to specify a restraint between two interatomic vectors, e.g. C1 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C2 and C3 \\(\\rightarrow\\) C4, then we would use something like this:\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\" : \"angle\",\n                        \"atom1\" : \"C1\",\n                        \"atom2\" : \"C2\",\n                        \"atom3\" : \"C3\",\n                        \"atom4\" : \"C4\",\n                        \"value\" : 120.0,\n                        \"weight\" : 1.0})\n\n\nOther input methods\nIf we didn’t have unique atom labels for each of the atoms in the asymmetric unit, we can instead specify the atoms involved by referring to their associated Z-matrix and the position of the atom within the Z-matrix. For example, a distance restraint between the 4th atom in zmatrix_1.zmatrix and the 8th atom in zmatrix_3.zmatrix, with a distance of 3.0 Å and weight of 0.5 can be added via:\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\" : \"distance\",\n                        \"zm1\":\"zmatrix_1.zmatrix\", \"atom1\":4,\n                        \"zm2\":\"zmatrix_3.zmatrix\", \"atom2\":8,\n                        \"value\":3,\n                        \"weight\":0.5})\nAlternatively, assuming that the zmatrices were added sequentially starting with zmatrix_1.zmatrix:\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\":\"distance\",\n                        \"zm1\":1, \"atom1\":4,\n                        \"zm2\":3, \"atom2\":8,\n                        \"value\":3.0,\n                        \"weight\":0.5})\nThe same principles apply to angle and torsion restraints, they just require changing the “type” key/value pair, as well as additional entries for atoms 3 and 4, and their associated ZMs. For example:\nmystructure.add_restraint({\"type\":\"torsion\",\n                        \"zm1\":2, \"atom1\":4,\n                        \"zm2\":2, \"atom2\":8,\n                        \"zm3\":2, \"atom3\":12,\n                        \"zm4\":2, \"atom4\":14,\n                        \"value\": 130.0,\n                        \"weight\": 0.5})\n\n\nRunning GALLOP\nNow that we have our restraints specified, let’s set up our GALLOP parameters and loop, then run it. We’ll need to remember to pass the use_restraints = True bool to the local optimiser function. The easiest way to do this is to modify the value in the minimiser_settings dictionary.\nAgain, we’ll go for 10 swarms of 1000 particles, and run GALLOP for 5 iterations.\n\nimport time\nswarm = Swarm(mystructure, n_particles=10000, n_swarms=10)\nexternal, internal = swarm.get_initial_positions()\n\n# Get the default minimiser settings\nminimiser_settings = local.get_minimiser_settings(mystructure)\n\n# Set the learning rate to what we obtain from a rigid ring model and learning rate finder\nminimiser_settings[\"learning_rate\"] = 0.0325\n\n# Toggle this run to use the restraints we added\nminimiser_settings[\"use_restraints\"] = True\n\n# Set the total number of iterations for the GALLOP run\ngallop_iters = 5\nstart_time = time.time()\n# The main GALLOP loop\nfor i in range(gallop_iters):\n    # Local optimisation of particle positions\n    result = local.minimise(mystructure, external=external, internal=internal,\n                run=i, start_time=start_time, **minimiser_settings)\n    # Particle swarm update generates new positions to be optimised\n    external, internal = swarm.update_position(result=result)\n\n100%|██████████| 10/10 [00:00&lt;00:00, 714.26it/s]\nGALLOP iter 0001 LO iter 0500 min chi2 159.8: 100%|██████████| 500/500 [00:48&lt;00:00, 10.32it/s]\nGALLOP iter 0002 LO iter 0500 min chi2 88.3: 100%|██████████| 500/500 [00:48&lt;00:00, 10.31it/s] \nGALLOP iter 0003 LO iter 0500 min chi2 87.0: 100%|██████████| 500/500 [00:48&lt;00:00, 10.29it/s] \nGALLOP iter 0004 LO iter 0500 min chi2 86.9: 100%|██████████| 500/500 [00:48&lt;00:00, 10.23it/s] \nGALLOP iter 0005 LO iter 0500 min chi2 86.8: 100%|██████████| 500/500 [00:48&lt;00:00, 10.37it/s] \n\n\nAs you can see, we hit approximately the same \\(\\chi^2\\) value as we did with the browser interface, though due to the use of my desktop PC rather than a cloud-based GPU, things took a little longer.\nAs a point of comparison, let’s rerun the jobs above, this time without the restraints.

Whilst this is a small sample size, it does seem like restraints are providing a significant benefit.\nHowever, using restraints comes at a cost: as we can see, using the restraints results in an approximately 7 % increase in the time taken to perform the runs. This is simply because there are more operations that GALLOP has to carry out in order to calculate the restraint penalty term values and their associated gradients. However, this computational cost is fairly small and hopefully it’s obvious that even for relatively simple problems like the one we are tackling here, the benefits outweigh the increased computational cost!"

    "text": "Other applications\nRestraints in general enable the inclusion of additional information into the SDPD process, reducing the search space and (hopefully) increasing the probability of success. The information used to specify the restraints can come from a wide variety of sources. Whilst we have focussed here on using known bond lengths and expected torsion angle values, we could also include information from a multitude of other sources.\nFor example, solid state NMR experiments can be used to obtain intramolecular end-to-end distances. As was demonstrated by Middleton et al, these distances can be used to force the molecualar fragments being optimised to adopt conformations close to that at the global minimum during the early stages of optimisation, significatly reducing the time taken to solve the crystal structure.\nCrystallographic databases can also be used to derive both positional and conformational information. For example, protonated quarternary ammonium cations and chloride counter ions are commonly found approximately 3 Å apart, providing the basis of an easily applied restraint. In two previous posts, we looked at solving the crystal structure of verapamil hydrochloride, which includes this feature. I ran 20 swarms of 1000 particles for 10 iterations, both with and without the Cl1 to N1 3 Å restraint applied, with a weight of 1. The learning rate was set to 0.05 in both cases. With restraints, 6 swarms reached the global minimum (30 %), whilst without, only 2 swarms (10 %) obtained the solution. This is a very small sample size, but I still think it’s reasonable to suggest that the restraint provides some benefit for very little effort! Hydrogen-bond propensity calculations could also be used to inform restraints on the basis of likely intermolecular contact distances.\nThe use of database-derived torsion angle distribution information is well established in SDPD via the use of techniques such as the Mogul Distribution Bias (MDB) which has been shown to greatly improve success rates in DASH. It worth noting that you can also use MDB information in GALLOP. This is described in the context of the browser interface and Python API in other posts. Other torsional information could be manually included via restraints if desired.\nRecent advances in the field of protein folding allow both protein conformations and intramolecular residue contact distances to be predicted. Clearly such information could also be used to inform restraints for SDPD applications."

    "text": "It’s been a long time since I updated this blog! I’m hoping to be able to update it at least a few more times this year, as I have some ideas for posts which I think some people may find useful. One post will (finally!) cover how to use TPUs with GALLOP. It’s taken this long because the free TPU resources available online up to this point have been extremely limited. Fortunately, Kaggle have given their users a generous TPU quota and importantly, access to a powerful enough VM to make the most of the performance of the TPU using pytorch, which is the library GALLOP uses for all of its calculations. I am also working on some stuff unrelated to GALLOP which I’m quite excited about, with a focus on PXRD indexing. I’m hoping to get it written up as a paper before the end of the year. If I manage that (and it’s a big if), there will be an accompanying blog post giving an informal summary of the work.\n\n\nThis is a very brief follow up to a previous post in which we looked at using GALLOP to optimise using the profile rather than intensity \\(\\chi^2\\) figure of merit. In that post, we showed that doing this potentially provides a small level of benefit in terms of the speed with which the runs are completed, though the number of solutions and frequency with which they are obtained is not significantly affected. As the bulk of the time spent by GALLOP is used for conversion of internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, the potential performance benefits are somewhat limited. Despite this, I’ve added the functionality to the latest version of GALLOP so you can try it for yourself. At the moment, this functionality is limited to data that has been fitted using DASH.\nIn this post, I want to talk about an idea I had recently on a situation in which this added capability in GALLOP may be useful."
